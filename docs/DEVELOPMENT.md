# Development

Open Match 2 `core` (aka `om-core`) is a golang application designed to be built using [CNCF Buildpacks](https://www.cncf.io/projects/buildpacks/), and our primary build process specifically uses [Google Cloud's buildpacks](https://cloud.google.com/docs/buildpacks/overview). 

## Build

> [!NOTE]
> Users developing against Open Match probably don't need to re-compile `core`, and should in almost all cases just use one of the pre-built images provided in the public Artifact Registry.

The Open Match maintainers build `core` [remotely using Cloud Build on Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/docs/buildpacks/build-application#remote_builds).  A typical build goes something like this, with the repo cloned,  `gcloud` initialized, and an existing [Docker Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/store-docker-container-images) called `open-match`:
```
# Update the dependencies to the latest versions and kick off a Cloud Build
go get -u && go mod tidy && gcloud builds submit --async --pack \
image=$(gcloud config get artifacts/location)-docker.pkg.dev/$(gcloud config get project)/open-match/om-core
```
There is no `cloudbuild.yaml` or `Dockerfile` required for this. [Google Cloud's buildpacks](https://cloud.google.com/docs/buildpacks/overview) takes care of everything.

### For Maintainers

The following represent best practices but not required when doing a new release:

* Go to [cloud.google.com](cloud.google.com) and open a clean Cloud Shell terminal. Run `go version` to find the version offered by default in Cloud Shell. Then kick off a Cloud Build using pack (as in the command above) and find the lines that specify the default version of Golang being used there.  You should see lines similar to this in the build logs:
```
Step #1: ===> BUILDING
Step #1: [builder] target distro name/version labels not found, reading /etc/os-release file
Step #1: [builder] === Go - Runtime (google.go.runtime@0.9.1) ===
Step #1: [builder] Go version not specified, using latest available Go runtime for the stack "ubuntu2204"
Step #1: [builder] 2025/08/27 06:00:39 [DEBUG] GET https://go.dev/dl/?mode=json
Step #1: [builder] ***** CACHE MISS: "go"
Step #1: [builder] Installing Go v1.24.6.
``` 
use the lower of these two versions in the `go.mod` files in Open Match 2 related projects (`go mod edit -go=<VERSION>`). This is to ensure that users following the instructions to build in their own projects can do their own builds using the default Cloud Shell environment and the latest Google Cloud buildpacks.
* After verifying that the build works with the latest dependencies, commit any changes to `go.mod` to the repo. 

## Deploy
The `deploy` directory contains sample `service.yaml` and `cloudbuild.yaml` files, either of which you can edit to deploy an `om-core` service to Cloud Run in Google Cloud.  Typically the `service.yaml` is easier to adapt to manually deploying via command line, and `cloudbuild.yaml` is easier to adapt to a continuous build system, although feel free to use them as you see fit.

You should populate the following:
* Your [VPC network](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/overview).  Unless your company has turned on the `constraints/compute.skipDefaultNetworkCreation` org policy, your Google Cloud project will have a VPC created already, named `default`.
* Your Service Account created for `om-core`. The `deploy/cloudrun-sa.iam` file lists all the roles the service account will need. 
* Your Redis instance IP address(es, OM supports configuring reads and writes to go to a master/replica respectively if you wish) that can be reached from Cloud Run. We test against Cloud Memorystore for Redis using the configuration detailed in [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/redis/connect-redis-instance-cloud-run).

With the `service.yaml` file populated with everything you've configured, you can deploy the service with a command like this:
```
gcloud run services replace service.yaml
```
If you instead intend to use the `cloudbuild.yaml` file populated with everything you've configured, you can deploy the service with a command like the one listed in the comment at the top of the file (requires you to have enabled Cloud Build and have appropriate service account permissions):

You may need to adjust the scaling configuration and amount of memory `om-core` is allowed to use depending on your matchmaker.

`core` is just a gRPC/HTTP golang application in a container image and can be deployed in most environments (local Docker/Minikube/Kubernetes/kNative) with a little effort. 

## Protocol Buffers
The `proto` directory contains the protocol buffer definition files and documentation about using and building them. If you're developing against Open Match, you probably want to write your Matchmaking Functions ('MMFs') in a language you're comfortable in, so you'll want to use `protoc` to generate libraries in your preferred language.

## Testing
You can run the golang unit tests using `go test ./...` from the `core` directory. 

If you want to quickly test a running copy of `om-core`, the file `docs/example_ticket.json` has an example of a JSON-formatted ticket that will pass validation against the `v2/tickets` RESTful HTTP API endpoint with a command like this:
```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)" \
-d "$(jq -c . example_ticket.json)" ${URL}/tickets
```
If the creation is successful you should get a response like this:
```
{"ticketId":"1716339182-0"}
```

## Running locally
If you want to just run the `om-core` application locally, you can `go run .` in the root directory, and it will start up. However, by default, most of the configuration variables are set to work out-of-the-box in Cloud Run, so when running locally you'll probably want to set (at least) the following environment variables:

* `OM_OTEL_SIDECAR=false` By default, the application tries to export metrics to a local OpenTelemetry sidecar, and running without one will cause an error. Use `false` to instead run a local metrics exporter that doesn't rely on an OpenTelemetry Collector.
* `OM_STATE_STORAGE_TYPE=memory` By default, the application tries to store state in Redis (and you should always use that setting in production).  `memory` instead uses only a volitile local copy of state in RAM, and ignores the values set in all the `*REDIS*` config variables. Only use this for testing.
* `OM_LOGGING_FORMAT=text` By default log lines are written in JSON, setting this to `text` is a bit more human-readable.

Additionally you may also want to adjust these:

* `PORT` defaults to 8080, but if you are running another process on that port locally, you'll want to pick a new port.
* `OM_LOGGING_LEVEL` defaults to `info`, but you may want to see more details by using `debug` or even `trace` when testing locally.
